Notes for Dusko:


General:

 * the idea is to employ maven module(s) that would contain core functionality
 shared among all platform specific modules (ui for andriod, 
 desktop, desktop html5(?), web(?), iOS(?))
 * as much code as possible should be common as this would presumably save time
 when adding Virutor UI clones for new platforms 
 * this means that also UI related code could be put here as long as
 it doesn't have dependency to any UI library (generic interfaces etc.)
 
 Content:
 * UCI connector to Virutor Chess engine written in C/C++
 	 see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Chess_Interface
 * Move generator to check moves done by human or computer players
 * PGN parser/formatter http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation
 * chess clock abstraction
 * data structures abstracting chess games, positions, players, game properties, etc.
 * others   

TODO:

* abstraction around GameStateServer is broken.
    a) it should be more lightweight and represent a UCI connector for a single 
		UCI engine  
	b) master game data should be stored in UiGame (currently in java-desktop, it should be moved here)
* there are redundant data structures
* there are not enough tests (the coverage would be insufficient - we should try to employ some coverage tool)
* there is a lot of unimplemented functionality (game final states, UCI connector, etc.)
* ServerGame - a check clock abstraction - is buggy
* code style should be improved a lot (dead code, formatting, unused imports, javadoc, etc.)
