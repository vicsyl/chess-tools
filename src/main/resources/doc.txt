continue:

pgn game test -> should be able to test for mate, round (unknown), etc.
CONTINUE: pgn tests
CONTINUE(?): PlyCount?, TimeControl, Comments!!!!! -> rewrite the parsing to account for comments!!! 

CONTINUE: FEN tag -> failed test and other things (half - full move clock -> also parsing and formating)


CONTINUE: things around timer

plan:

	implement 
		a) 50 move rule
		b) threefold rep. rule                 OK 
			i) implement zobrist hashing!!!!   OK
		c) insuficcient mating material... how is this actually enforced / implemented in pgn / practice / engines?	
			
			
			
			
Features:

FEN - doesn't support the shorter format with only 5 parts (without full move clock)

MODEL/FEN - use fullmove clock for the ordinal number of the move
